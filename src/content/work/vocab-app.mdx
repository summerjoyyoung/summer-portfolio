## User Interviews  

### Research Objective  
To gain a deeper understanding of how users **learn, retain, and stay motivated** while expanding their vocabulary, I conducted **user interviews**. The goal was to identify common behaviors, challenges, and preferences to inform the app‚Äôs design.  

### Interview Participants  
To gather diverse insights, I interviewed five individuals from different professional backgrounds, all of whom actively engage in vocabulary learning for their work or personal growth:  

- **Alice, 26** ‚Äì Research Assistant, frequently learns industry-specific terminology.  
- **Kim, 24** ‚Äì Aerospace Engineer, expands technical vocabulary for work.  
- **Tremaine, 26** ‚Äì Project Manager, enhances communication and leadership terminology.  
- **Alicia, 24** ‚Äì Tattoo Artist, discovers and learns new artistic and cultural terms.  
- **Maria, 24** ‚Äì Subtitle Translator, constantly learns new words to improve translations.  

Each participant provided insights into their vocabulary learning habits, challenges, and preferences, shaping the design of the app to better meet user needs.  

### Interview Questions  
During the interviews, I asked participants the following questions to uncover their learning strategies, pain points, and motivations:  

- **What are your initial feelings when you start learning new vocabulary? Why do you feel that way?**  
- **How do you keep track of what you‚Äôve learned and what you need to learn?**  
- **Tell me about some strategies you use to learn new vocabulary.**  
- **What struggles do you often encounter when you are trying to learn new vocabulary?**  
- **How do you fit learning new vocabulary into your schedule?**  
- **What challenges do you come across when trying to fit learning new vocabulary into your schedule?**  
- **What motivates you to study new vocabulary?**  

### Key Findings & Insights  

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Users Rely on Flashcards and Term Lists**  
üí¨ *"I usually make flashcards or lists when studying new words. It's the easiest way to review quickly."*  
- Users commonly use **flashcards and definition lists** as their primary study tools.  
- While effective, this method lacks **interactivity and contextual learning**, making it harder to retain words long-term.  

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Learning in Context Enhances Retention**  
üí¨ *"I remember words better when I see them used in a sentence or in something I‚Äôm watching."*  
- Users struggle to retain words when memorizing isolated definitions.  
- **Exposure to words in real-world contexts**, such as **reading articles, watching videos, or using them in conversation**, helps with retention.  

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Motivation Declines Over Time**  
üí¨ *"I start off excited to learn, but I lose motivation after a while if it feels repetitive."*  
- Many users experience **diminished motivation** over time, especially when learning feels tedious.  
- Features like **gamification, progress tracking, and reminders** could help maintain engagement.  

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Mobile Accessibility is Key for Consistent Learning**  
üí¨ *"I study when I have a few minutes‚Äîlike waiting for the bus or on my break."*  
- Users fit vocabulary learning into their daily routines **when resources are easily accessible on their phone**.  
- The app should support **short, convenient study sessions** that fit into users' busy schedules.  

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Media Consumption as a Source for New Words**  
üí¨ *"Sometimes I hear a new word in a podcast or a show and look it up later."*  
- Users naturally **discover new words through media** (e.g., articles, videos, podcasts).  
- The app should **help users capture and learn new words in real-time** to integrate into their study sessions.  

### Design Implications  
Based on these insights, the vocabulary app should:  
‚úÖ **Keep users motivated** through gamification, streaks, and progress tracking.  
‚úÖ **Make it easy to find new words** by allowing users to save words from media they consume.  
‚úÖ **Support contextual learning** by incorporating definitions, example sentences, and real-world usage.  
‚úÖ **Enable quick, mobile-friendly study sessions** so users can learn on the go.
